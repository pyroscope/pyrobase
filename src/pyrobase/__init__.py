""" General Python Helpers and Utilities.

    pyrobase assembles general Python helper functions and classes that
    can be applied to any project. That includes some additional tasks
    for the Paver build tool, an improved xmlrpc2scgi module, unit test
    helpers, and generic base modules for various domains.

    All modules have unit tests (currently pyrobase.paver is an exception),
    and the goal is to reach >80% coverage.

    See U{https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrobase/wiki} for more.
